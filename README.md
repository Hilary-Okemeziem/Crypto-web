Live demo: https://cryptoexpress-dc4ab.web.app/

This Crypto App was built with React JS and is hosted on Firebase. It is a frontend project with a firebase backend.

I made use of Coin Gecko API for all of the coin data and Firebase for user authentication so users can sign-up and sign-in to their account with an email address in order to save their favorite coins.

I made use of Firestore which is cloud storage of firebase to save data, with this users will be able to store/save specific data(coins) from the frontend by clicking the star icon.

The project also has an in-built light/dark theme mode which I did using Context API and CSS

The project was styled with Tailwind CSS
